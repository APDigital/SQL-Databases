Data Types and Nulls

Write a "partial text" query - that is, I can find the details of all people whose first name begins with a substring (e.g. "Da" will return Daniel and David)

SELECT * FROM Employee
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'A%'

Add a "last contribution date" column to the pension fund table. Modify your existing query that adds 5% of everyone's salary to their pension fund, to update the last contribution date as well

ALTER TABLE PensionFundTable
ADD LastContributionDate varchar NULL
ALTER TABLE PensionFundTable
ALTER COLUMN LastContributionDate DATETIME NULL

UPDATE PensionFundTable
SET Contribution = Contribution + (Employee.Salary * 0.05), LastContributionDate = GETDATE()
FROM PensionFundTable
JOIN Employee
ON Employee.Id = PensionFundTable.EmployeeID

You've already got a query that finds all the employees without pension funds. How many different approaches can you find to solving this particular problem?

ALTER TABLE PensionFundTable
ALTER Column PensionProviderID INT NULL

SELECT Employee.FirstName + ' ' + Employee.LastName AS EmployeeName, PensionFundTable.PensionProviderID
FROM Employee
JOIN PensionFundTable
On PensionFundTable.EmployeeID = Employee.Id
WHERE PensionProviderID IS NULL

DELETE FROM PensionProvider 
WHERE Id = 4
